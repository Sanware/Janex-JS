# Janex
A free open-source framework which can be used to build Machine Learning tools, LLMs, and Natural Language Processing scripts with full simplicity.

<h2> What is the purpose of Janex? </h2>

Monopolistic companies are confining their Artificial Intelligence research to themselves, and capitalising on it. Even companies that swore to open source their software (OpenAI) went back on their morals, with the releases of GPT-3+, as did other powerful businesses.

These businesses go on to sell their research to the Government, and sell access to it to the public. As such, my aim is to create a framework that you can use to easily construct your own language models, and other machine learning algorithms, as I believe this power should not be held firmly in the hands of corrupt rich politicians and advantaged capitalists. (It will take a while before it reaches a practical level)

Released under the **new** Free Lily License 1.0, Janex will improve and become a useful tool for users to conduct their own research in the potential of Artifical Intelligence.
